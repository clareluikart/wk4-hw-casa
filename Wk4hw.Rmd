This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

#read in world countries simple features
world_countries <- read_sf(here("World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson"))

# read in inequality data
inequality <- read_csv(here("HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv"))

# create data frame of just what we need
inequality_2010_2019 <- select(inequality, country, iso3, gii_2019, gii_2010)

# create column for difference in gii
inequality_2010_2019 <- inequality_2010_2019 %>%
  clean_names(.,) %>%
  rename(., iso = iso3) %>%
  select(iso, gii_2019, gii_2010) %>%
  mutate(., difference = gii_2019 - gii_2010)

# clean names world_countries
world_countries <- clean_names(world_countries)

# change country code in world countries to iso3
world_countries$iso <- countrycode(world_countries$iso, "iso2c", "iso3c")

# join data
world_countries_difference_gii <- left_join(world_countries, inequality_2010_2019, by="iso")

# plot data
qtm(world_countries_difference_gii,

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
