This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(usethis)
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
library(tinytex)
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(sf)
library(fs)
library(usethis)
```
```{r}
world_countries <- here::here("World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson")
inequality <- read_csv(here("HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv"))
inequality %>%
  select(iso3, gii_2019, gii_2010) %>%
  mutate(difference = gii_2019 - gii_2010)

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
